title: "Deleting a Function"

<div id="deleting_a_function" class="registered_link"></div>

A function can be deleted from the database using the `DROP FUNCTION` command.

```sql
DROP FUNCTION [ IF EXISTS ] <name> [ (<parameters>) ]
    [ CASCADE | RESTRICT ];
```

Where `name` is the name of the function to be dropped.

!!! Note
    -   The specification of the parameter list is required in Advanced Server under certain circumstances such as if this is an overloaded function. Oracle requires that the parameter list always be omitted.

    -   Usage of `IF EXISTS, CASCADE`, or `RESTRICT` is not compatible with Oracle databases. See the `DROP FUNCTION` command in the *Database Compatibility for Oracle Developers SQL Guide* for information on these options.

The previously created function is dropped in this example:

```sql
DROP FUNCTION simple_function;
```
