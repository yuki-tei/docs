## What is Parallel Apply?

!!! Note Improved in PGD 5.2
This feature has been enhanced in PGD 5.2 and is recommended for more scenarios. 
!!!

Parallel Apply is a feature of PGD that allows a PGD node to use multiple writers per subscription. This behavior generally increases the throughput of a subscription and improves replication performance.

When Parallel Apply is operating, the transactional changes from the subscription are written by multiple writers. However, each writer ensures that the final commit of its transaction doesn't violate the commit order as executed on the origin node. If there's a violation, an error is generated and the transaction can be rolled back.

This mechanism has previously meant that if a transaction is pending commit and modifies a row that another transaction needs to change, and that other transaction executed on the origin node before the pending transaction did, then the resulting error could manifest itself as a deadlock if the pending transaction has taken out a lock request. 

Additionally, handling the error could increase replication lag, due to a combination of the time taken to detect the deadlock, the time taken for the client to rollback its transaction, the time taken for indirect garbage collection of the already applied changes, and the time taken to redo the work. 

This is where Parallel Applyâ€™s deadlock mitigation, introduced in PGD 5.2, comes into play. For any transaction, Parallel Apply's receiver process look at the writers for transactions already scheduled to see if they are writing to a row that the current transaction wants to write. If it does, the receiver marks the row as needing to wait until the other transaction is committed before apply its change to the row.  
This ensures that rows are written in the correct order.  

### Configuring Parallel Apply

Two variables which control Parallel Apply in PGD 5, [`bdr.max_writers_per_subscription`](/pgd/latest/reference/pgd-settings#bdrmax_writers_per_subscription) (defaults to 8) and [`bdr.writers_per_subscription`](/pgd/latest/reference/pgd-settings#bdrwriters_per_subscription) (defaults to 2).

```plain
bdr.max_writers_per_subscription = 8
bdr.writers_per_subscription = 2
```

This configuration gives each subscription two writers. However, in some circumstances, the system might allocate up to 8 writers for a subscription.

You can only change [`bdr.max_writers_per_subscription`](/pgd/latest/reference/pgd-settings#bdrmax_writers_per_subscription) with a server restart.

You can change [`bdr.writers_per_subscription`](/pgd/latest/reference/pgd-settings#bdrwriters_per_subscription) for a specific subscription, without a restart by:

1. Halting the subscription using [`bdr.alter_subscription_disable`](/pgd/latest/reference/nodes-management-interfaces#bdralter_subscription_disable).
1. Setting the new value.
1. Resuming the subscription using [`bdr.alter_subscription_enable`](/pgd/latest/reference/nodes-management-interfaces#bdralter_subscription_enable). 


First though, establish the name of the subscription using `select * from bdr.subscription`. For this example, the subscription name is `bdr_bdrdb_bdrgroup_node2_node1`.

```sql
SELECT bdr.alter_subscription_disable ('bdr_bdrdb_bdrgroup_node2_node1');

UPDATE bdr.subscription
SET num_writers = 4
WHERE sub_name = 'bdr_bdrdb_bdrgroup_node2_node1';

SELECT bdr.alter_subscription_enable ('bdr_bdrdb_bdrgroup_node2_node1');
```

### When to use Parallel Apply

Parallel Apply is always on by default and, for most operations, we recommend that it's left on.

From PGD 5.2, Parallel Apply works with CAMO. It is not compatible with Group Commit or Eager Replication and should be disabled if Group Commit or Eager Replication are in use. 

Up to and including PGD 5.1, Parallel Apply should not be used with Group Commit, CAMO and eager replication. You should disable Parallel Apply in these scenarios. If, using PGD 5.1 or earlier, you are experiencing a large number of deadlocks, you may also want to disable Parallel Apply or consider upgrading.

### Monitoring Parallel Apply

To support Parallel Apply's deadlock mitigation, PGD 5.2 adds columns to [`bdr.stat_subscription`](/pgd/latest/reference/catalogs-visible#bdrstat_subscription). The new columns are `nprovisional_waits`, `ntuple_waits` and `ncommmit_waits`. These 
are metrics which indicate how well Parallel Apply is managing what would have previously been deadlocks. They are not 
indicative of overall system performance.

The `nprovisional_waits` value reflects the number of operations on the same tuples being performed by concurrent apply transactions. These are provisional waits which aren't actually waiting yet but could. 

If a tuple's write needs to wait until it can be safely applied, it is counted in `ntuple_waits`. Fully applied transactions which waited before being committed are counted in `ncommit_waits`. 

### Disabling Parallel Apply

To disable Parallel Apply set [`bdr.writers_per_subscription`](/pgd/latest/reference/pgd-settings#bdrwriters_per_subscription) to 1.
